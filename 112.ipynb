        "Static type checking allows you to see any type errors without running your code and even can be used to understand your code better.\n",
        "You will learn how to do that with MyPy, which is by far the most stable and popular tool used for this purpose.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Learn about static type checking with MyPy.\n",
        "- Learn the k-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm.\n",
        "- Learn how to do data extraction, transformation, and analysis with using defaultdict.\n",
        "- Learn how to read CSV files using iterators.\n",
        "- Understand how Python dictionaries work.\n",
        "- Learn how to apply Clean Code principles in Python.\n",
        "- Learn how to use built-in documentation and docstrings to document your code.\n",
        "- Practice using strings in Python by doing the Pig Latin exercise.\n",

        "\n",

        "For this exercise, write a Python function (pig_latin) that takes a string as input, assumed to be an English word. The function should return the translation of this word into Pig Latin. You may assume that the word contains no capital letters or punctuation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This exercise isn't meant to help you translate documents into Pig Latin for your job. (If that is your job, then I really have to question your career choices.) However, it demonstrates some of the powerful techniques that you should know when working with sequences, including searches, iteration, and slices. It's hard to imagine a Python program that doesn't include any of these techniques."
